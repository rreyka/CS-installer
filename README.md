## How to install

To launch and run this 

```bash
  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rreyka/CS-installer/refs/heads/main/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh

```

Or if you want to directly run without saving this code, just use : 
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rreyka/CS-installer/refs/heads/main/install.sh)

```
